# PROJECT PLAN

## 1. Project Objectives:

* Build and train a malware detection model such that the model
satisfy metrics conditions, which are defined in the charter.   
* Deploy trained model (API) into company's server, and monitor the
API.

## 2. Project Schedule:

__Note__:
- 1 week is equivalent to 5 man-days.
- Data Collection step has been completed already, hence this task
will not be enlisted in this plan.

| Task | Complexity | Duration Estimation |
| :--- | :----: | :----: |
| **1. Data Engineering** | | **2 weeks (10 man-days)** |
| 1.1. Data Exploration & Visualization | Low | 2 man-days |
| 1.2. Data Cleaning | Low | 1 man-day |
| 1.4. Data Transformation | Medium | 2 man-days |
| 1.5. Feature Extraction and Selection | High | 5 man-days |
| **2. Model Engineering** | | **3 weeks (15 man-days)** |
| 2.2. Model Building & Training | Medium | 5 man-days |
| 2.3. Model Testing & Evaluation | Medium | 5 man-days |
| 2.4. Fine-tuning the model | High | 5 man-days |
| **3. MLOps** | | **3 weeks (15 man-days)** |
| 3.1. Building the API | High | 5 man-days |
| 3.2. Deploying the API to company's server | Medium | 3 man-days |
| 3.3. Monitoring | High | 7 man-days |

__Total Estimation__: 40 man-days (8 weeks)

## 3. Project Risks:

| Risk Name | Risk Level | Ways to mitigate |
| :----: | :----: | :--- |
| Task not completed on due date | High | Focus on work and use time as efficiently as possible. |
| Error occurred so that rolling back is implemented | High | Ensure that all steps are done properly and minimize error by using highly-effective methods. |
| Model's quality is not as expected | Medium | Ensure the research step is done properly for the best fit method, and also the fine-tuning step in order to achieve the best accuracy. |
