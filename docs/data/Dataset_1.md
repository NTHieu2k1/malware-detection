# Dataset 1 Report

## 1. Raw data:

The dataset is obtained by crawling and receiving sample files. This dataset
contains total of 8018 samples, mostly are PE samples. These samples are
divided into 2 categories: benign and malware.

Here is an overview table about the raw dataset:

| Category | Number of samples | Source of samples |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Benign | 6504 | Crawled from http://taimienphi.vn |
| Malware | 1514 | Given by team leader |

## 2. Validated data:

As there were several non-PE samples in the dataset, the whole dataset
was validated to filter out non-PE samples. After validation, only
5311 benign samples were actually PE sample, while the number of malware
PE samples was still the same (1514 samples).

## 3. Explored data:

Each sample of the dataset was put into PE reader for retrieving its
PE attributes, then labelled.

As a result, 54 attributes were retrieved. These raw feature set include
DOS header features (except two), Signature feature, file header and
optional header features.

Furthermore, after exploration, all benign samples were put in the top
of the table, and malware ones were put in the bottom.

## 4. Preprocessed data:

In preprocessing, several features were dropped. Those features were:

- e_magic (non-distinguishing feature)
- Magic (non-distinguishing feature)
- Signature (non-distinguishing feature)
- Machine (non-distinguishing feature)
- TimeDateStamp (time-like feature)

Moreover, categorical variables (benign/malware) were encoded into binary
values ("benign" as 0 and "malware" as 1). And the preprocessed data
was organized in random order, unlike the newly-explored data.

## 5. Selected feature set:

After training a Random Forest model and putting into a Select From
Model instance with importance threshold, only 13 features were chosen.

Here is the list of 13 chosen features:

- e_lfanew
- NumberOfSections
- Characteristics
- MajorLinkerVersion
- SizeOfCode
- SizeOfInitializedData
- SizeOfUninitializedData
- AccessOfEntryPoint
- BaseOfData
- MajorImageVersion
- SizeOfImage
- CheckSum
- DllCharacteristics
